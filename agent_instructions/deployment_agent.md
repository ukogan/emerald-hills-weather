## Delivery Pipeline Architecture

### **Current Environment Tiers**:
1. **Development**: Agent directories (`emerald-hills-weather-{agent}/`)
2. **Staging**: `emerald-hills-weather/` (localhost:3001) ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL
3. **Production**: GitHub + Vercel deployment ‚è≥ PENDING SETUP

### **Integration Workflow** (Current Manual Process):
```bash
# 1. Agent completes ticket
python3 pm.py complete E1-T2 backend src/services/dataCollection.js

# 2. Manual integration (NEEDS AUTOMATION)
cp -r emerald-hills-weather-backend/src/* emerald-hills-weather/src/

# 3. Integration testing (NEEDS FORMALIZATION)
cd emerald-hills-weather && npm test && npm run dev

# 4. Deploy to production (NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION)
git push origin main  # Triggers Vercel deployment
```

### **Target Automated Workflow**:
```bash
# 1. Agent completes ticket (unchanged)
python3 pm.py complete E1-T2 backend

# 2. Automated integration (YOUR RESPONSIBILITY)
./scripts/integrate-agent.sh backend E1-T2

# 3. Automated testing (YOUR RESPONSIBILITY)  
./scripts/staging-tests.sh

# 4. Deployment approval (YOUR RESPONSIBILITY)
./scripts/deploy-production.sh --approval-required
```

## Integration Management

### **Agent Completion Monitoring**:
Monitor these completion patterns and trigger integration:

```bash
# Watch for ticket completions
python3 pm.py status | grep "üîÑ\|‚úÖ"

# Trigger integration when agent marks complete
# Current completions ready for integration:
# - Backend: E1-T2 (data collection), E1-T3 (correlation analysis)
# - Need: E2-T1 (design), E2-T2 (frontend), before frontend integration
```

### **Dependency Coordination**:
**Critical Dependencies You Must Manage**:
- **E2-T2 (Frontend)** depends on **E2-T1 (Design)** completion
- **E2-T4 (Frontend Integration)** depends on **E2-T3 (Backend Forecast APIs)**
- **E2-T5 (QA Testing)** depends on all E2 components integrated

### **Quality Gates Before Production**:
- [ ] **All tests pass**: Unit, integration, and API tests
- [ ] **Performance validation**: 3-second load time requirement met
- [ ] **Architecture approval**: Architect agent has reviewed integration
- [ ] **QA approval**: QA agent has validated functionality
- [ ] **Security review**: No exposed API keys or vulnerabilities

## Deployment Scripts You Need to Create

### **1. Integration Automation** (`scripts/integrate-agent.sh`):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Automate agent directory integration to staging
AGENT=$1
TICKET=$2

echo "üîÑ Integrating $AGENT agent work for $TICKET"
cp -r emerald-hills-weather-$AGENT/src/* emerald-hills-weather/src/
cd emerald-hills-weather

# Run integration tests
npm test
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Integration successful"
    git add . && git commit -m "integrate: $AGENT $TICKET"
else
    echo "‚ùå Integration failed"
    exit 1
fi
```

### **2. Staging Validation** (`scripts/staging-tests.sh`):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Validate staging environment health
cd emerald-hills-weather

# Start server for testing
npm run dev &
SERVER_PID=$!
sleep 5

# Test critical endpoints
curl -f http://localhost:3001/api/health || exit 1
curl -f http://localhost:3001/api/weather/current || exit 1
curl -f http://localhost:3001/api/weather/correlation || exit 1

# Clean up
kill $SERVER_PID
echo "‚úÖ Staging validation complete"
```

### **3. Production Deployment** (`scripts/deploy-production.sh`):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Deploy to production with approval gates
if [ "$1" != "--approval-required" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå Deployment requires approval"
    exit 1
fi

echo "üöÄ Deploying to production..."
git tag -a v$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M) -m "release: $(git log -1 --pretty=%B)"
git push origin main
git push --tags

echo "‚úÖ Deployment initiated"
```
