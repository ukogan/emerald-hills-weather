### Scope

This security policy covers:
- The main application code in `/src`
- Docker configurations and deployment scripts
- CI/CD pipeline configurations
- Dependencies and third-party integrations

### Out of Scope

- Issues in development or testing environments
- Vulnerabilities in dependencies (please report to upstream maintainers)
- Social engineering or physical attacks

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

- Never commit API keys, passwords, or other secrets
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Keep dependencies updated
- Run security scans before submitting PRs

### For Deployment

- Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts
- Enable two-factor authentication where possible
- Keep operating systems and container runtimes updated
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity
- Use HTTPS/TLS for all network communications

## Security Features

The application includes several security measures:

- **Container Security**: Non-root user execution in Docker containers
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- **API Key Protection**: Environment-based secret management
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses that don't leak sensitive information

## Responsible Disclosure

We are committed to working with security researchers and the community to improve our security posture. We appreciate responsible disclosure and will work with you to:
