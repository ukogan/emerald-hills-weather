# Weather Dashboard Implementation Plan

## Technical Approach
**Overall Architecture:**
Single-page React app with Node.js backend that collects weather data from multiple APIs, applies correlation models, and serves personalized forecasts.

**Key Technology Decisions:**
- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS (simple, fast, mobile-first)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (good for API integration and JSON handling)
- **Database**: SQLite (simple, local storage for correlation data and accuracy tracking)
- **APIs**: OpenWeatherMap + National Weather Service (free tiers)
- **Hosting**: Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend) - free tiers
- **Caching**: In-memory cache for API responses (reduce API calls)

## Epic Breakdown

### Epic 1: Data Foundation & Validation

**Value**: Validates project feasibility and de-risks critical assumptions
**Estimated Effort**: Large (most technically risky)
**Priority**: 1 (must complete before other work)

#### Tickets:
- [ ] E1-T1: Weather API integration - [Agent: backend] - Connect to OpenWeatherMap and NWS APIs
- [ ] E1-T2: Data collection system - [Agent: backend] - Collect hourly data from 5-6 stations
- [ ] E1-T3: Basic correlation analysis - [Agent: backend] - Compare stations to identify patterns
- [ ] E1-T4: Elevation adjustment calculation - [Agent: backend] - Apply atmospheric lapse rate formula
- [ ] E1-T5: API validation testing - [Agent: qa] - Verify data quality and rate limits

### Epic 2: Core Weather Dashboard
**Goal**: Basic functional dashboard showing current conditions and simple forecast
**Value**: Delivers primary user value - personalized weather for Emerald Hills
**Estimated Effort**: Medium
**Priority**: 2
**Dependencies**: E1 must be complete

#### Tickets:
- [ ] E2-T1: Dashboard UI design - [Agent: design] - Clean, mobile-first weather interface
- [ ] E2-T2: Current conditions display - [Agent: frontend] - Show temperature, conditions, "feels like"
- [ ] E2-T3: Forecast API endpoints - [Agent: backend] - Serve personalized predictions
- [ ] E2-T4: Frontend-backend integration - [Agent: frontend] - Connect UI to prediction API
- [ ] E2-T5: Basic dashboard testing - [Agent: qa] - Validate accuracy and usability

### Epic 3: Intelligence & Accuracy
**Goal**: Show why predictions are different and track accuracy over time
**Value**: Builds user trust and validates model effectiveness
**Estimated Effort**: Medium
**Priority**: 3
**Dependencies**: E2 must be functional

#### Tickets:
- [ ] E3-T1: Station correlation display - [Agent: frontend] - Show which stations influence prediction
- [ ] E3-T2: Marine layer detection - [Agent: backend] - Identify marine layer vs. inland conditions
- [ ] E3-T3: Accuracy tracking system - [Agent: backend] - Compare predictions to actual conditions
- [ ] E3-T4: Prediction confidence UI - [Agent: frontend] - Show confidence levels and reasoning
- [ ] E3-T5: Intelligence features testing - [Agent: qa] - Validate correlation display and accuracy

## Development Phases
