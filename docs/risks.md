# Weather Dashboard Risk Assessment

## Critical Risks (Project Killers)

### Risk 1: Weather API Data Availability
**Description**: Free weather APIs may not provide sufficient historical data or nearby station coverage to build meaningful correlation models
**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: High - would stop project if we can't get enough data points
**Root Cause**: Relying on free APIs that may have limited historical data or station coverage
**Early Warning Signs**: 
- APIs only provide current data, no historical correlation possible
- Nearby stations don't have consistent data availability
- Rate limits prevent collecting enough data for analysis
**Mitigation Plan**: 
- Test API capabilities before full development (Phase 1 validation)
- Identify multiple API sources (OpenWeatherMap + NWS + others)
- Consider paid API tier if free limits are too restrictive
**Validation Approach**: Build simple API data collector in first week to test data availability
**Owner**: Backend Agent
**Status**: ðŸ”´ Unaddressed

### Risk 2: Correlation Model Complexity
**Description**: Building accurate correlation models between weather stations and local conditions may be more complex than anticipated
**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: High - could require machine learning expertise we don't have
**Root Cause**: Underestimating complexity of meteorological modeling
**Early Warning Signs**:
- Simple correlation analysis shows no meaningful patterns
- Need to account for too many variables (wind, humidity, pressure, time of day)
- Accuracy doesn't improve over generic forecasts
**Mitigation Plan**:
- Start with simple linear correlation, add complexity gradually
- Focus on temperature only (ignore precipitation, wind)
- Use proven elevation adjustment formulas (lapse rate)
- Validate with manual correlation analysis first
**Validation Approach**: Manual analysis of 1-2 weeks of data before building automated model
**Owner**: Backend Agent
**Status**: ðŸ”´ Unaddressed

## Significant Risks (Major Delays)

### Risk 3: API Rate Limits & Costs
**Description**: Weather APIs may have rate limits that prevent real-time updates or require paid plans
**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium - would require different update strategy or costs
**Root Cause**: Underestimating API usage requirements
**Early Warning Signs**:
- Free tier limits hit during development
- API costs exceed project budget
- Update frequency limited to hourly instead of 30-minute intervals
**Mitigation Plan**:
- Cache API responses aggressively
- Use multiple free APIs to distribute load
- Design for longer update intervals if needed
- Consider one-time paid tier if reasonable
**Validation Approach**: Calculate exact API usage requirements upfront
**Owner**: Backend Agent
**Status**: ðŸ”´ Unaddressed

### Risk 4: Marine Layer Detection Accuracy
**Description**: Automatically detecting marine layer conditions may be difficult without specialized meteorological expertise
**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium - core feature may not work reliably
**Root Cause**: Oversimplifying complex meteorological phenomena
**Early Warning Signs**:
- Simple coastal vs. inland temperature differential doesn't correlate with marine layer presence
- Need humidity, wind direction, and other complex factors
- Manual observation doesn't match automated detection
**Mitigation Plan**:
- Start with simple temperature differential approach
- Add manual override for marine layer days
- Focus on obvious cases first (hot vs. cool days)
- Validate against your personal observations
**Validation Approach**: Compare simple detection with your daily observations for 1 week
**Owner**: Backend Agent + PM
**Status**: ðŸ”´ Unaddressed

### Risk 5: User Interface Complexity
**Description**: Displaying correlation data and prediction confidence in an understandable way may be challenging
**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: Medium - reduces user trust and adoption
**Root Cause**: Technical complexity doesn't translate to clear user experience
**Early Warning Signs**:
- Dashboard feels too complex or technical
- User can't quickly understand why prediction differs from standard forecast
- Too much data overwhelms simple weather check
**Mitigation Plan**:
- Design simple, clear interface first
- Progressive disclosure (simple view + details on demand)
- Focus on one key number: "Your temperature: 78Â°F vs. forecast: 65Â°F"
- User test early and often
**Validation Approach**: Create mockups and test with yourself daily
**Owner**: Design Agent + Frontend Agent
**Status**: ðŸ”´ Unaddressed

## Minor Risks (Small Delays)

### Risk 6: Mobile Responsiveness
**Description**: Weather dashboard needs to work well on mobile for quick checks
**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: Low - can be fixed with additional CSS work
**Root Cause**: Desktop-first development approach
**Early Warning Signs**: Desktop version doesn't scale well to mobile screens
**Mitigation Plan**: Mobile-first CSS design, regular testing on phone
**Validation Approach**: Test on actual mobile device throughout development
**Owner**: Frontend Agent
**Status**: ðŸ”´ Unaddressed

## Risk Mitigation Priority
1. **Risk 1 (API Data)** - Validate immediately before any coding
2. **Risk 2 (Correlation Model)** - Test with manual analysis first week
3. **Risk 3 (API Limits)** - Calculate requirements upfront
4. **Risk 4 (Marine Layer)** - Start simple, iterate based on observations
5. **Risk 5 (UI Complexity)** - Design and test early
6. **Risk 6 (Mobile)** - Address during frontend development

## Overall Risk Assessment

### Go/No-Go Decision Framework
- **GO**: API data available + simple correlation shows promise + manageable complexity
- **CONDITIONAL GO**: API data limited OR correlation unclear BUT workarounds possible
- **NO-GO**: No useful API data OR correlation analysis shows no patterns

### Current Status: CONDITIONAL GO
**Rationale**: Project has genuine value and technical risks are addressable, but depends heavily on API data quality and correlation analysis results.

**Conditions for full GO**:
1. âœ… Validate API data availability and quality (Week 1)
2. âœ… Confirm simple correlation patterns exist (Week 1)
3. âœ… Verify rate limits are manageable (Week 1)

**Next Review Date**: End of Week 1 after data validation

## Risk Monitoring

### Week 1 Validation Tasks
- [ ] Test OpenWeatherMap API for historical data access
- [ ] Test NWS API for nearby station coverage
- [ ] Manual correlation analysis: San Jose vs. local conditions
