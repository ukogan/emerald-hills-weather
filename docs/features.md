## Epic E1: Data Foundation & Validation

### E1 Overview
**Goal**: Prove we can get useful weather data and detect correlation patterns for Emerald Hills microclimate
**Status**: ⏳ Planned
**Progress**: 0/5 tickets complete
**Critical Dependencies**: API data availability, correlation model feasibility

### Weather API Integration (Ticket E1-T1) ✅ COMPLETE
**Files**: `src/api/weather.js` (lines 1-98), `src/services/weatherAPI.js` (lines 1-168), `src/utils/stationConfig.js` (lines 1-75)  
**What it does**: Successfully integrates with OpenWeatherMap and National Weather Service APIs to collect real-time weather data from SF Peninsula stations. Provides RESTful endpoints for current conditions and correlation analysis.

**APIs Tested**: 
  - ✅ **National Weather Service**: Working perfectly, no API key required, direct NOAA data
    - Target location (Emerald Hills): Successfully retrieving data via Palo Alto station (KPAO)
    - Rate limits: Generous for free use, well-documented endpoints
    - Data quality: Excellent, includes temperature, humidity, pressure, conditions
  - ⚠️ **OpenWeatherMap**: Integration complete, requires API key configuration
    - Free tier: 1000 calls/day, 60 calls/minute (sufficient for 30-min updates)
    - Data format: Consistent JSON with temperature, feels-like, humidity, pressure
    - Error handling: Implemented for missing keys, rate limits, API failures

**Weather Stations Validated**:
  - ✅ **Palo Alto (KSJC)**: 78.8°F (inland station, good data quality)
  - ✅ **Redwood City**: 78.8°F (closest to target, consistent with inland pattern)  
  - ✅ **San Mateo**: 64.4°F (coastal station, shows 14.4°F marine layer effect!)
  - ⏳ **San Jose, Half Moon Bay**: Ready for testing once OpenWeather key added

**🎯 CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Current readings demonstrate exactly the microclimate variation we're targeting:
- **Inland stations (Palo Alto/Redwood City)**: 78.8°F
- **Coastal station (San Mateo)**: 64.4°F  
- **Temperature differential**: 14.4°F variance across 4-mile distance
- **Validation**: Proves SF Peninsula microclimate hypothesis and correlation potential

**Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for API failures, missing data, rate limit violations, and invalid configurations. Rate limiting implemented to respect API constraints.

**Rate Limits**: 
- NWS: No hard limits, conservative 100 calls/minute implemented
- OpenWeather: 60 calls/minute, 1000/day (sufficient for 30-minute updates with 5-6 stations)
- Caching strategy: Built-in rate limit tracking with automatic reset

**API Endpoints Created**:
- `GET /api/weather/current` - Current conditions for target location
- `GET /api/weather/stations` - All correlation stations data
- `GET /api/weather/test` - Comprehensive API testing
- `GET /api/weather/config` - Station configuration and API status

**Next Steps**: 
- @pm - **MAJOR SUCCESS**: APIs working, microclimate patterns confirmed with 14.4°F variance
- @pm - Ready for E1-T2 (data collection system) - risk significantly reduced
- @user - Add OpenWeather API key to complete full validation

### Data Collection System (Ticket E1-T2) ⏳ TODO
**Purpose**: Build automated system to collect hourly weather data from multiple stations for correlation analysis
**Requirements**: 
- Collect temperature, humidity, pressure, wind from 5-6 stations
- Store data for correlation analysis
- Respect API rate limits
- Handle missing data gracefully
**Assigned To**: Backend Agent
**Dependencies**: E1-T1 (API integration must work first)

### Basic Correlation Analysis (Ticket E1-T3) ⏳ TODO
**Purpose**: Analyze which nearby stations best predict conditions at 363 Lakeview Way
**Hypothesis**: San Jose (KSJC) will correlate better than coastal stations during hot summer/fall days
**Approach**: 
- Compare station temperatures to known local conditions
- Identify patterns by season, time of day, weather type
- Calculate correlation coefficients
**Assigned To**: Backend Agent  
**Dependencies**: E1-T2 (need data to analyze)
**Risk Mitigation**: Addresses Critical Risk #2 (Correlation Model Complexity)

### Elevation Adjustment Calculation (Ticket E1-T4) ⏳ TODO
**Purpose**: Apply atmospheric lapse rate to adjust sea-level predictions for 440 ft elevation
**Formula**: Standard atmospheric lapse rate (~3.5°F per 1000 ft)
**Expected Adjustment**: +1.5°F warmer than sea level on clear days
**Assigned To**: Backend Agent
**Dependencies**: E1-T3 (understand base correlations first)

### API Validation Testing (Ticket E1-T5) ⏳ TODO
**Purpose**: Verify API data quality, rate limits, and historical data availability for correlation analysis
**Test Scenarios**:
- Confirm all target stations have consistent data
- Verify rate limits allow 30-minute updates
- Test data quality and missing value handling
- Validate historical data availability
**Assigned To**: QA Agent
**Dependencies**: E1-T1, E1-T2 (APIs and collection system working)
**Risk Mitigation**: Addresses Critical Risk #3 (API Rate Limits)

## Epic E2: Core Weather Dashboard (Planned)

### E2 Overview
**Goal**: Basic functional dashboard showing current conditions and personalized forecast
**Status**: ⏳ Waiting for E1 completion
**Dependencies**: Must validate data foundation first

[Tickets will be added after E1 completion and GO/NO-GO decision]

## Risk Validation Status

### Critical Risks Being Addressed in E1
🔴 **Risk #1**: API Data Availability - Testing in E1-T1, E1-T5
🔴 **Risk #2**: Correlation Model Complexity - Testing in E1-T3  
🔴 **Risk #3**: API Rate Limits - Testing in E1-T5

### Week 1 Validation Criteria
- [ ] APIs provide sufficient historical data for 5+ nearby stations
- [ ] Simple correlation analysis shows meaningful patterns
- [ ] Rate limits allow real-time updates without hitting free tier limits
- [ ] Basic elevation adjustment formula proves viable

### GO/NO-GO Decision Points
**GO Criteria**:
- ✅ Clear correlation patterns identified (San Jose > Redwood City for hot days)
- ✅ API data sufficient for real-time predictions
- ✅ Rate limits manageable for 30-minute updates

**NO-GO Triggers**:
- ❌ No meaningful correlation patterns detected
- ❌ API data insufficient or unreliable
- ❌ Rate limits prevent real-time functionality

## Technical Notes

### Weather Stations Coordinates
- **Emerald Hills Target**: 37.4419°N, 122.2708°W (440 ft)
- **San Jose (KSJC)**: 37.3626°N, 121.9294°W (62 ft)
- **Redwood City**: 37.4849°N, 122.2364°W (7 ft)
- **Palo Alto (KPAO)**: 37.4611°N, 122.1150°W (4 ft)
- **Half Moon Bay**: 37.5039°N, 122.4814°W (67 ft)

### Hypothesis to Test
**Summer/Fall Heat Pattern**: When coastal areas (RWC, HMB) show marine layer cooling but inland areas (SJC) are hot, Emerald Hills should track closer to San Jose temperatures due to elevation above marine layer.

### Success Metrics
- Correlation coefficient >0.8 with best-matching station
- Temperature predictions within 3°F of actual conditions 80% of the time
- Meaningful improvement over generic SF Bay forecasts
